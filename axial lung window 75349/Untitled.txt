Findings in the abdomen consist of gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis, a liver cyst in segment 7 and an unclear focal liver lesion in segment 4A and a lesion in the right adrenal gland. All findings were present at a CT-colongraphy done several month earlier. In that study (with and without i.v. contrast) the adrenal lesion was consistent with a lipid-rich adenoma.

Additional findings: Patchy ground-glass opacities in basal lungs bilaterally. 

Case Discussion
The radiologist suggested COVID-19 and subsequent testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus.

There are many case reports of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients presenting with only abdominal symptoms and fever, without symptoms from the respiratory tract.
