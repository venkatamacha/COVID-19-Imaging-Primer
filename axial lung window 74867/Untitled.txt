Case Discussion
This patient tested positive for COVID-19. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus is spreading throughout the world. After China, which accounts for the majority of global cases, Italy is one of the nations with the highest number of confirmed infected cases (as of 9 March 2020). Early diagnosis improves the patient's outcome and the CT findings have been shown to be more sensitive than the confirmatory RT-PCR test for diagnosis in early disease.
