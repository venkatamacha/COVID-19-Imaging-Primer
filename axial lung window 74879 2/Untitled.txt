Air space consolidation is present at the right lower lobe posterobasal and superior segments.

Ground glass opacity nodule also is seen at the right middle lobe lateral segment.

Case Discussion
The interesting point of this case is that there is a large unilateral area of air space consolidation involving the right lower lobe but the ground glass and/or consolidative opacities of COVID-19 pneumonia are most commonly bilateral 1,2. This patient had positive RT-PCR testing for COVID-19.
