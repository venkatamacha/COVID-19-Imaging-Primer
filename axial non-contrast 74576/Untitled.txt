Multilobar and bilateral ground‐glass opacities are seen in both lungs, mostly in mid to lower lungs, although all lobes are affected, with a peripheral subpleural distribution. 

Case Discussion
This case was of a physician that had a fever for 4 days with sudden onset dyspnea on the fourth day post initial presentation. Chest CT in our department and subsequently RT-PCR testing confirmed COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a zoonotic illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2).

The primary findings on chest CT have been reported as 1-4:

ground-glass opacities (GGO) in all hospitalized patients
crazy paving appearance (GGOs and inter/intralobular septal thickening)
air space consolidation
No mediastinal lymphadenopathy has been seen 2.
